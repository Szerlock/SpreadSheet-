# Comments to Evaluators:

The current rendition of code is the best that I was able to come up with. All tests that I have written at the current time do currently pass.
This does not mean that my code will be 100% correct (just very likely). I closely followed the algorithm given in the assignment instructions.
Helper methods were used when possible to eliminate chunks of repeated code. I used them wherever possible, but also did not try to overdo it.


NOTE:
I encountered some warnings that I was unsure if I was able to fix. There might be something in the starter code given that gives us these errors. Unsure If I had the clearance to fix these errors. I fixed as many as I could besides these two.
I wanted to note these below that these were the only two errors that I was unsure if I could go ahead and fix.

However, it might be due to not fully applying my style cop correctly.
    1. A warning that the file copyright should match the copyright text from the settings.(line 1)
    2. A warning that the file header name documentation should match the file name (line 1)
    3. Element return value should be documented (line 307)
