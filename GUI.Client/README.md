# Comments to Evaluators:
As a pair, we used Andy's Spreadsheet MVC implementation, whilst the GUI and the completion of this assignment was done together by Ryan and Andy. We managed to have a 
working spreadsheet. It is to note that some features are not perfect, such as having to double click on a cell to enter a value. However, we decided these are small issues
that do not have any significant impact on our program, and would not be an efficent use of our time to fully knead out all the small issues. One thing to note is that we left any debug code
in our file, just in case we have to debug in the future, but mainly because the code is already working, and we don't want to risk any chances of it possibly breaking.

# Partnership

Most of the code was written using the driver, navigator method of pair programming. This consisted of both of us using one laptop to code in person or online.
However, due to schedule constraints and workload from other classes (and life), there some instances where either of us worked on some of the code alone. Of course, 
communication was still faciliated during this time, to keep each other updated. We mainly worked alone to debug some small issues, add documentation and comments, or seeked
help from TAs or the professor during office hours separately.

The partnership was a success. Although scheduling was a little akward, we both managed to finish and deliver the code in a reasonable amount of time. In fact, the bare minimum 
for the code was already done by Thursday - two days after the assignment released - and there was plenty of time left to add improvements to the code. Skill level in terms of coding
were relatively even. Communication was most effective, as the both of us kept each other updated regularly on when to work on the code, and when to meet up to work on the assignment. 
Scheduling hours with each other, and pacing went really well. The navigator/driver strategy helped Ryan type the code, whilst Andy gave some ideas and correcting syntatical mistakes.
We were very effective in our approach to time.

The main issue that we ran into was not our team-work neccessarily, as that went well. I think that we had some scheduling complications that made it difficult to work together at the same time.
I think we could have worked on it together 100% of the time, but there were some cases where we had to work on some parts of this code separately (mainly to debug and add fixes).
