# Comments to Evaluators:

The tests for this project were all written by myself, excluding the autograder tests which are used to fix errors and bugs after the assignment is due.

NOTE:
	ChatGPT was used in some cases where specified. SEE # CHATGPT

# Assignment Specific Topics
No additional write-up required

# Consulted Peers:

Nick Santos (In different CS3500 class)

None were used for this testing portion

# ChatGPT:

PS4 -
	ChatGPT was used in the creation of writing some tests. However, it was only specifically used to generate more complex equations, and used sparringly.
	These tests are seen at the end of my code, and ChatGPT was only used to generate the equation, as well as evaluate the result. Futhermore, I can verify that 
	the results do match the equation, by plugging it into a calculator, such as desmos.

	Prompts:
		- "Can you Make a complex equation with only numbers and +,-,*,/,),(, and it has an exact value with no rounding"

		Example Ans: Sure! Here’s the complex equation as a string in Python: equation_str = "((12 + 8) * (5 - 3)) / 2 - (9 / 3) + 7 * (1 - 0.5)"

		- "Now give me a random equation with variables such as x1, y1, z1, etc, no square roots, just basic arithmetic""

		Example Ans: Got it! Here’s the equation using only basic arithmetic operations, formatted as a string in C#: string equationStr = "((x1 + 2 * y1) * (3 - z1)) / 4 - (5 * x1 - 2) + (y1 - z1)";
