# Comments to Evaluators:
My tests cover some of the instruction examples that we are given. My tests are based around my implementation. I lean on the fact
that my code and tests should be mostly correct (or at least on the right track) based on the fact that I was able to pass the stress
test that was given. As for testing, I managed to have 100% code coverage. 

Additionally, I sectioned off my tests Pre and Post tests. The pre-tests are the tests written prior to my implementation,
whilst the post tests are the tests that I wrote as I implemented the code, and after I implemented my code. I tried
to add enough tests, but not too many where it felt redundant. At some point, I felt I test as much as I could given the small set of 
functions that I had to implement.

NOTE:

For some reason, I did not have full code coverage via gradescope, but I did have 100% coverage on my end, unsure why this happens. I went to
TA hours with Tim, and we could not figure out the issue why this was happening.
